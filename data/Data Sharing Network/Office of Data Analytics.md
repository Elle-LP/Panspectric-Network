A successful bid for Police Transformation Funding was used to develop a prototype office for data analytics, which is the basis for our new Data Science and Innovation Centre. The aim of the original prototype was to develop locally based partnerships to share data and develop a local analytics capability that would enable better multi-agency collaboration on issues such as road safety, knife crime, youth offending and serious violent crime. Current demand for the Data Science and Innovation Centre services is still embryonic, although this picture is expected to change this year (7)

Appears to link to particular apps within Qlik Sense eg. Road Safety, Youth Offending, Serious Violent Crime (7)

it has been confirmed that the Office for Data Analytics links directly into the Qlik Sense system (28 p.18)
