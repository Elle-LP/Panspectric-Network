This is the Capita System which has ben implemented in other Police forces across the UK, the only one I know without further checking is South Wales Police, it is a modular system that can be linked up with ControlWorks and PoliceWorks

"EvidenceWorks DEM provides a core database that integrates with an agency’s tiered storage solutions. It includes the capability to ingest, catalogue, store, analyse and share media from multiple sources. Once stored, all items are audited and can be watermarked to provide added security. They can also then be added to digital case files and forwarded to criminal justice partner agencies.

The solution is scaleable and can be deployed locally or regionally, and offers a modular structure for phased growth – to best suit an agency’s specific requirements. 

**EvidenceWorks DEM provides:**

-   interfaces to multiple controlled sources of media
-   the ability to handle media from uncontrolled sources, either through direct interfaces or via third party solutions
-   full MoPI compliance
-   integration with records management systems, including Niche RMS, plus other existing police systems
-   integrated workflow management
-   full search, retrieve, edit and share functionality
-   full access, security and activity audits.

EvidenceWorks DEM fully integrates with the EvidenceWorks interview recording solution to provide a future-proof, digital recording, storage and management solution, providing continuity ‘from capture to court'."
