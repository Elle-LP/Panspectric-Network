Suspect that this stands for Out of Court Disposal Managment - is this what happens when pre-emption of a predicted crime happens or is this simply a log of these Disposals accessible by the Police Force?

"The Out of Court Disposals Scrutiny Panel met on 2 March to scrutinise cases on the theme of Domestic Abuse. The theme was selected in order to scrutinise appropriate use of disposals in cases of domestic abuse, ensuring outcomes were victim-focused and that appropriate referrals were made with respect to victim care and safeguarding
considerations. The Panel had previously noted the anomaly in national guidance, whereby Conditional Cautions may be used only in exceptional cases involving domestic abuse, whereas the lesser disposal of a Simple Caution can be used." (41)
