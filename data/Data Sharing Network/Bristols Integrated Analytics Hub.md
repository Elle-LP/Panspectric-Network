Also referred to as Insights Bristol.  "Insight Bristol is an integrated analytics hub made up of staff from [[Avon & Somerset Police]] and [[Bristol City Council]] based at Bridewell Police Station, Bristol.  Insight Bristol has developed the [[Think Family]] Database and from this unique data source, a number of predictive risk models are run. This new approach combines data from over 30 sources into a central data warehouse, giving us the best picture of social issues facing families Bristol has ever had. This helps to inform early intervention, enabling us to target those most in need across the city" (18 p.15)

"The technology required to build the Integrated Services Analytics Hub will build on the existing capability already in place at Avon and Somerset Police. This capability is appropriately scaled for the volume of data analytics currently being processed and will need to be scaled up to support the volumes of data proposed without impacting the existing operational ASC analytics" (21 p.12)

The Office for Data Analytics has very similar members to the Bristol Integrated Analytics Hub but they appear to be two  two distinct entities.  They appear to have the same members according to (21)

"The transformation project will look to exploit and connect to existing collaborative data hubs where possible, such as Connecting Care. This is the hub-of-hubs concept. e.g. rather than connecting to each and every public health body, we connect to existing connecting care hub and use a single interface. This significantly reduces the level of effort required to build a golden nominal (ie the Master Data Management work)."  (21 p.5) -is this a master data set?

"The hub would include a range of data on social issues relating to individuals, families and households across the force. This existing data, held by public agencies, will be shared in response to statutory duties held in legislation placed upon local authorities, health partners and other relevant parties. A detailed strategy will be produced as part of this programme of work; however the approach is briefly outlined here. All partners cited in this document will have signed Tier 1 Information Sharing Agreements (ISAs). These overarching documents declare intent to share, with specific use cases detailed in Tier 2 ISAs. The hub will utilise legal gateways (responsibilities placed on partners), to satisfy the conditions of the Data Protection Act. For example, the Crime and Disorder Act (1998) places a duty on a wide range of agencies “to do all they can to reasonably prevent crime and disorder in their area”. Similar duties are expressed in the Children and Families Act (2014), Education Act (2002), Immigration and Asylum Act (1999), Local Government Act (2000), Localism Act (2011), Children Leaving Care Act (2000), Criminal Justice Act (2003) and the Welfare Reform Act (2012). A full Privacy Impact Assessment, along with supporting Privacy Notice, was conducted as part of the Bristol blueprint." (21, p.19) These are the clauses contained in many privacy policies that may allow data sharing without consent.
