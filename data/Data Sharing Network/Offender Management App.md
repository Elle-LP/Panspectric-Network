[[Qlik Sense]] (35)

This provides individualised risk scores for offenders. It is claimed that 250,000 offenders in the area that given a risk score. THe risk score is a percentage from 0 to 100 that "idenitifes the likelihood of offending in combination with the harm that an offender carries" (2 p.76)

certain crimes are weighted eg sexual assaults, rapes, GBH (2)

Model includes an escalation risk (2)

Accuracy rate is higher for predicting offenders than victims (2)

It has been confirmed in an interview by (2) that many aspects important in determining risk are excluded because they are intelligence reports and Qlik Sense doesn't pick up intelligence (2 p.78).  It is wondered what is actually be classed as intelligence as intelligence is clearly used somewhere in Qlik Sense but it is not known in what capacity.

in a different interview by (2 p.81) it is revealed that someone could have been identified as high risk due to being linked with a murder despite being eliminated from that investigation.  This raises questions in relation to what is classed as intelligence data and what Qlik can actually use to make the risk scores

"using predictive modelling and profiling of an offender with level of risk, cohort and crime pattern" (3)
