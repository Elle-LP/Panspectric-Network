[[Qlik Sense]] (35)

THe following information is viewable on a video (39) with an labeled intelligence but with part of the screen cut out of the frame so it may be in a different intelligence app. The following is what is contained in the app and is viewable from 1 minute 40 seconds in the video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBvQUI83lfQ

- offender risk by category
- intelligence type (level 2)
- Intel gaps
- Intel submission dates
- intelligence detail
(39)

It has been confirmed in an interview by (2) that many aspects important in determining risk are excluded because they are intelligence reports and Qlik Sense doesn't pick up intelligence (2 p.78).  It is wondered what is actually be classed as intelligence as intelligence is clearly used somewhere in Qlik Sense but it is not known in what capacity
