Avon and Somerset have been found to not record approximately 13,700 crimes each year (as at 2016) - this is about 10% of crimes that are unrecorded including serious offences such as rape and violence.   The force also has a poor record of recorded reported crimes involving modern slavery.

This includes reports of officers not believing reports of crime where the victm suffers from mental health issues.  This highlights a discriminatory culture within the force that is not often referred to in the literature.

It has also been recorded that officers fail to record some crimes where a victim is reporting multiple crimes (17)

This means their historic crime data has excluded large amounts of crime and has been discriminatory in regards to certain victims of crime.
