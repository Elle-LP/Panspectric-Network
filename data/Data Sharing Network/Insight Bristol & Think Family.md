Data is shared to Insights Bristol, also known as Bristol's Integrated Analytics Hub (16)

Think Family may be the Data Warehouse referred to in (18 p.15).  "The transformation project will look to exploit and connect to existing collaborative data hubs where possible, such as Connecting Care. This is the hub-of-hubs concept. e.g. rather than connecting to each and every public health body, we connect to existing [[connecting care]] hub and use a single interface. This significantly reduces the level of effort required to build a golden nominal (ie the Master Data Management work)."  (21 p.5) -is this a master data set?

Think Family is a manifestation of the Government's Troubled Family Programme

"The Think Family Programme will combine information about families with multiple high cost problems, poor school attendance, youth crime, anti-social behaviour, unemployment, domestic violence and younger children who need help and with a range of physical and mental health problems. The programme will use this information to identify families that fall within six headline problems covering crime, education, domestic abuse, health, child safeguarding and financial exclusion agendas. It will be used for predicative analysis by reviewing those people who currently demonstrate poor outcomes and establishing those people most at risk of also demonstrating these outcomes into the future. Once a family has been identified as meeting the threshold for support from this programme, the Council are then able to allocate limited resources to work more effectively with families who have multiple needs. The data gathered will also be used as a part of a prevention strategy trying to identify families who may not meet the threshold for direct support from this project but who are possibly on the wrong trajectory and, if not worked with, may become more troubled. This information may be shared with relevant partners as part of our early intervention strategy". (17)

"The data hub consists of a range of data on social issues relating to individuals, families and households across the city. The data is existing data held by public agencies which has been shared through information sharing protocols and in response to statutory duties held in legislation placed upon local authorities and relevant partners. There are as of March 2016 30 sets of social issues and 170,000 individuals in the data hub. The data is merged to provide a single understanding of a person, family or household. That information is held in a secure database with the local authority IT systems. It is correctly governed, auditable and meets the security requirements set out. Only certain nominated people have access to the information. Any inaccuracies identified are rectified, any unnecessary information is removed and records are only kept for the purpose and duration of the programme. There is capacity across the city to work with in excess of 1,000 families a year as part of our early intervention strategy".(17)

The data that is used for the Think Family scoring is also used by Avon & Somerset Police to predict offenders and victims (29 p.21) - https://www.avonandsomerset-pcc.gov.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/VRU_Annual_Report_Jan_2020.pdf
