Future expectation is to have non-personalised health data being fed through this app from all the hospitals and NHS trusts in the area (29 p.23) 

The future aim is that non-personalised violence related health data from all Hospital Trusts in the area is fed into Qlik Sense and accessed by the Violence Reduction Unit through this application.

 Based on the Cardiff Model https://www.cardiff.ac.uk/research/impact-and-innovation/research-impact/past-case-studies/reducing-violent-crime

 The Cardiff Model provides a way to use data from hospitals to give more accurate numbers on violent crimes as many people go to hopsital and admit being assaulted but do not report it to the police.  By combining this anonymised data with other police data, it can be used to predict and/or prevent some violent crimes.
