"**IOM stands for Integrated Offender Management;** Established in 2008 as a pilot in Bristol, it combines the resource, knowledge and expertise of Police, Probation, Prison and Recovery Workers in a multi-agency approach to working effectively and dynamically with the most prolific offenders involved in committing serious acquisitive crime." (24)

The IOM is also being used for domestic abuse pilots within [[Avon & Somerset Police]] (25)

This is directly link to Lighthouse Safeguarding as the program carries out tagging to protect vulnerable people (27)  [[Lighthouse Safeguarding Unit]]

This also feeds directly into Qlik Sense (27) although it is suspected it goes via a particular app but there is no data I have found to confirm which [[Qlik Sense]]

Does this have any relation to the Integrated Offender Management, a predictive system used by West Midlands Police?  Need to confirm.
