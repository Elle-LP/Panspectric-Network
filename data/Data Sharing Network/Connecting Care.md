"Connecting Care is a local electronic patient record that allows health and social care professional directly involved in an individual’s care and support to share a summary of the medical record and any safeguarding concerns. Bristol City Council has worked with the South West Commissioning group to implement Connecting Care for children and families in the city and it is improving information sharing and speeding up enquiries in First Response. Safeguarding teams in health agencies are able to see if previous safeguarding referrals have been made for a child, or if a social worker is allocated."
