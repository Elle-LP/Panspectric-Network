"We are continuing to embed BRAG risk assessments within our ways of working. The BRAG tool prompts officers to think about how they address any aspect of vulnerability, regardless of the level of risk. It allows officers to record what action they think should happen in order to safeguard and protect any victim, or person. This enables us to make better decisions about when we should refer to social care and also for neighbourhood teams to identify where they can support vulnerable people locally and intervene earlier."
