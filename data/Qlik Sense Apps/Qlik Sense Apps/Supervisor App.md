The application also provides statistics such as Postive Outcome Rate (last 12m) and can be used to monitor staff performance (39)

"updates the crime elements every twenty minutes, the team Sergeant can task an action, then check and test that this has been completed within the shift â€“ as opposed to waiting for a daily refresh" (3)
