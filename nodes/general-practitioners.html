          <div id="content"><p>"<strong>Improving information sharing (Domestic Abuse)</strong><br />
In Somerset there is no central point of access that the police can use to share Domestic Abuse (DA) information or know who a personâ€™s GP is. This present challenges when sharing information, especially when people are at risk of serious harm. In July 2020 Somerset NHS CCG were allocated NHS covid funding to look at a possible solution to this issue. A single point of access within health was trialled to enable the sharing of DA reports. This worked very effectively and saw an increase in the volume of referrals from GPs around DA. This new funding will replicate this solution and hope help find a more permanent solution."  https://www.somerset.gov.uk/libraries-leisure-and-communities/safer-somerset-partnership-violence-reduction-unit/</p>

<p>GPs are sharing DA data but currently unsure how/when and to whom...</p>

<p><a href="somerset-survivors-sidas.html">Somerset Survivors (SIDAS)</a> describes how GPs can share information without consent after seeing a patient and completing a DASH risk assessment. https://somersetsurvivors.org.uk/professional-resources/information-for-gps/</p>

<p>GP's in Bristol, North Somerset and South Gloucestershire also share and view information through <a href="connecting-care.html">Connecting Care</a> https://www.connectingcarebnssg.co.uk/what-this-means-for-me/who-sharesviews-my-information/</p>
