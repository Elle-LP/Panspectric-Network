<p>Our Child Sexual Exploitation (CSE) report identifies vulnerable children at risk of CSE by combining a score of known risk factors with predictive analytics <a href="cse-risk-model.html">CSE - Risk Model</a>. Firstly, known risk factors (such as young people going missing) are identified in Police data and aggregated for an individual to produce an initial score. Then a predictive model – based on children who have been identified as sexually exploited by key workers  – is used to identify children at risk of CSE using wider vulnerability data from the Think Family Database. The methods are combined to produce a final score for each vulnerable child, which is made available to Safeguarding staff within Bristol City Council and the Police’s CSE team. The report is used to support and inform professional judgement: safeguarding decisions are always made by a trained professional. (12) </p>
