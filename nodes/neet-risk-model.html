<p>data comes from <a href="bristol-city-council.html">Bristol City Council </a>(15)</p>

<p>The Risk of Not in Education, Employment or Training (NEET) report uses predictive analytics to identify vulnerable children at risk of NEET. The predictive model uses data from education and the Think Family Database and is based on children who have been NEET for six months or more, starting between the ages of 16-17. This is made available to Safeguarding, Post 16 and Participation staff within Bristol City Council. It is our future aim to make the Risk of NEET score available to schools (at present school Safeguarding, Attendance and Careers staff may receive scores for benchmarking or relating to specific targeted intervention activity). The report is used to support and inform professional judgement: safeguarding decisions are always made by a trained professional (12)</p>
