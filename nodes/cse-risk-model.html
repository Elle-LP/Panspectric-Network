<p>The operation uses analytical techniques to identify perpetrator patterns of behaviour and children who are most likely to be at risk before they become victims of crime (7) Linked to <a href="operation-topaz.html">Operation Topaz</a> (7) <a href="child-at-risk-of-criminal-exploitation-risk-model.html">Child at Risk of Criminal Exploitation - Risk Model</a>(CCE)  identifies vulnerable children at risk of CCE by scoring known risk factors in Police data (such as drugs intelligence <a href="drug-alcohol-data.html">Drug &amp; Alcohol Data</a> <a href="drugs-or-alcohol-incident.html">Drugs or Alcohol Incident</a> relating to a young person existing in police systems). These risk factors are aggregated to produce a score for each young person. (7) (29)</p>

<p>Predictive analytics is not used because there is not yet a clearly defined group of criminally exploited children on whom to base a predictive model. The final score is made available to Safeguarding staff within Bristol City Council  and Avon and Somerset Police to ensure that those<br />
most at risk have support in place. The report is used to support and inform professional judgement: (12)</p>
