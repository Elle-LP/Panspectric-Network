          <h1> Unrecorded Crimes </h1>

          <div id="content"><p>Avon and Somerset have been found to not record approximately 13,700 crimes each year (as at 2016) - this is about 10% of crimes that are unrecorded including serious offences such as rape and violence.   The force also has a poor record of recorded reported crimes involving modern slavery.</p>

<p>This includes reports of officers not believing reports of crime where the victm suffers from mental health issues.  This highlights a discriminatory culture within the force that is not often referred to in the literature.</p>

<p>It has also been recorded that officers fail to record some crimes where a victim is reporting multiple crimes (17)</p>

<p>Full report can be read at https://www.justiceinspectorates.gov.uk/hmicfrs/publications/avon-and-somerset-crime-data-integrity-inspection-2016/</p>

<p>This means their historic crime data has excluded large amounts of crime and has been discriminatory in regards to certain victims of crime.</p>
